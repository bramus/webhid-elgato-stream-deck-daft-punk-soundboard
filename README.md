# WebHID Demo: Elgato Stream Deck Daft Punk Soundboard

Daft Punk Soundboard, with ability to connect a [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) using [WebHID](https://web.dev/hid/) to control the soundboard.

## Usage

### Manipulating the Soundboard

Click the buttons to trigger a sound, or use one of the keyboard shortcuts.

- Keys `1` and `2`: Switch between the pages
- Keys `QWER` and `ASDF`: Play sounds from first page
- Keys `UIOP` and `JKL,`: Play sounds from second page

_üí° Note that the sounds are paged and that only sounds from the currently active page will play. Pressing `U` when Page 1 is active won't work for example; you need to activate Page 2 first!_

### Linking the Elgato Stream Deck

1. Plug in the Stream Deck device into your computer.
1. Make sure the native Stream Deck App is not running. The buttons should show the Elgato Logo.
1. Open the demo and click the ‚ÄúConnect Stream Deck‚Äù button.
1. In the device picker, choose your Stream Deck device and click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.

_üí° Linking the Elgato Stream Deck is a one-time step. Once connected the browser will remember the connection._

_üë®‚Äçüî¨ The demo website is registered for [the WebHID Origin Trial](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/1074108511127863297), and therefore WebHID should be enabled by default. If you however don't see a connect button, go to <code>chrome://flags/</code> and manually enable ‚ÄùExperimental Web Platform Features‚Äù._

## Known Issues

- The visual feedback when pressing a button does not play nice with multiple successive presses on the same button. This because the CSS used for it is already applied after the first press, and layout won't be triggered after that.
