# WebHID Demo: Elgato Stream Deck Daft Punk Soundboard

## Usage

### Manipulating the Soundboard

Click the buttons to trigger a sound, or use one of the keyboard shortcuts.

- Keys `1` and `2`: Switch between the pages
- Keys `QWER` and `ASDF`: Play sounds from first page
- Keys `UIOP` and `JKL,`: Play sounds from second page

_üí° Note that the sounds are paged and that only sounds from the currently active page will play. Pressing `U` when Page 1 is active won't work for example; you need to activate Page 2 first!_

### Linking the Elgato Stream Deck

1. Plug in the Stream Deck device into your computer.
1. Make sure the native Stream Deck App is not running. The buttons should show the Elgato Logo.
1. Enable WebHID by enabling ‚ÄùExperimental Web Platform Features‚Äù through <code>chrome://flags/</code>.
1. Open the demo and click the ‚ÄúConnect Stream Deck‚Äù button.
1. In the device picker, choose your Stream Deck device and click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù.

_üí° Linking the Elgato Stream Deck is a one-time step. Once connected the browser will remember the connection._

## Known Issues

- The visual feedback when pressing a button does not play nice with multiple successive presses on the same button. This because the CSS used for it is already applied after the first press, and layout won't be triggered after that.
- For the sounds to play you need to have interacted with the page first. If you don't hear any sounds when pressing the Elgato Stream Deck buttons, first click _(using your mouse)_ somewhere on the soundboard and then retry.
